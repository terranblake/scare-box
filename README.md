## Scare Box; an overhaul of the traditional trick-or-treat experience

Scare Box is a self-contained shipping box that includes several components to enhance the "scare factor" of trick-or-treating by including visual, auditory, and atmospheric, effects. 

The box and its components include 2 settings, one for the children which is less scary and a second for adults. Both settings use suite of components to produce an honest scare in those who dare take more than one treat, or if they're simply too loud.

The treat component is housed inside the container at knee height for an average adult.

The trick component, is a combination of the items listed and detailed below:
- *Fog machine*; with its output directed into the shipping box, filling the container and spilling out of the gap in the lid and through randomly placed holes in the box. Controlled by a set timer
- *LIFX Light Bars* (though any addressable led strip would work); producing a lighting effect to draw in trick-or-treaters, highlighting the fog as it escapes the container, and producing the visual trick component detailed below. Controlled by the laptop.
- *Microphone* (any should work, but one with enough channels and sampling to distinquish between a metallic lid and a fog machine); Listens for ambient sound to determine when to initiate the trick. Controlled by the laptop.
- *Speaker* (any that has bluetooth or usb capability); produces auditory "siren songs" to draw in trick-or-treaters, switching to a more immediate BOO when instructed. Controlled by the laptop.
- *Laptop* (anything with 1+ usb ports); orchestrates the complete experience, sending commands to control the auditory and visual experience. Note; fog machine is set on an interval intended to keep the box filled without wasting fluids on the environment.

### Operation

At all times, a fog machine introduces atmospheric effects into the box to hide the internal components from view, while the microphone is always listening. Spooky?!

#### Non-trick

 Music is played through the speaker that matches the tone of halloween, lights are a calming, but bright pattern which react to the music being played.

 #### Trick

 When noise is detected on a frequency matched with the hinges of the box opening, or manually triggered, a timer is started. As the timer ticks down, the lights start to "glitch" and the audio becomes distorted. Once the timer ends, the music and lights are stopped abruptly, then a loud boo and flash of lights is played, followed by a HAPPY HALLOWEEN. The system then resets back to normal operation using a timer, reversing the distortion to the audio.

 ### Modes

 #### Child

 Softer, less scary trick. Mostly just flashing lights

 #### Adult

 Full output, brightness/audio/woofer, much scarier trick. Meant to actually scare you.

 ### Configuration

 - Manual trigger of trick or non-trick operation
 - Configuration of randomness in non-trick to trick switch
 - Manual switch of child to adult mode
 - Configuration of non-trick to trick delay (may want to delay longer for larger groups holding the lid open)
 - Configuration of trick to non-trick reset timing
